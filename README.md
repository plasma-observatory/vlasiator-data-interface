# vlasiator-data-interface

Simple examples to extract Vlasiator data (... but you need to download files first yourself)

## Installation

This depends on `analysator`, the below install instructions show how to install it. If you wish to poke at analysator internals, you should clone the repository at www.github.com/fmihpc/analysator and install it into your environment via `pip install -e path-to-repo` (and discard pip install from the below).

```
git clone https://github.com/plasma-observatory-simulations/vlasiator-data-interface.git
cd vlasiator-data-interface
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
