# vlasiator-data-interface

Simple examples to extract Vlasiator data (... but you need to download files first yourself)

## Installation

This depends on `analysator`, the below install instructions show how to install it. If you wish to poke at analysator internals, you should clone the repository at www.github.com/fmihpc/analysator and install it into your environment via `pip install -e path-to-repo` (and discard pip install from the below).

```
git clone https://github.com/plasma-observatory/vlasiator-data-interface.git
cd vlasiator-data-interface
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Vlasiator data
While Vlasiator is open source and there exists open Vlasiator datasets, especially outside of PO Yellow Book please observe the rules of the road laid out here while using Vlasiator data:
https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vlasiator/rules-of-the-road
... and inside the Yellow Book duties also of course use your common academic sense :).

See here for publicly available datasets.
